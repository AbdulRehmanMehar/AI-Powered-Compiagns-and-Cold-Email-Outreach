this week one of the most respected cold email experts in the game released a 90 page document this Google doc contained everything that he knows about cold email going into 2025 and this is the same guy that instantly Ai and Clay both use to run their cold email and believe me I would not have spent two entire days combing through every sentence in this document if I did not believe with a dead certainty that it was going to make me millions of dollars but don't worry you're not going to have to read the entire 90 Pages because I did that for you and in this video I'm just going to be giving you my key points and takeaways and I'm also going to be adding some of my two cents and opinions on some of the stuff that I might agree and disagree with now a big warning to you ADHD kid out there who is going to start this video and not finish it bookmarket come back to this video and take notes you are not going to get any better information about cold email and lead generation then you're going to get in this exact video and yes I'm going to be sharing the link to this document with all of my notes in it but I am not going to be linking it down below that's too easy you have to watch the video and I'm going to be saying where to go get it about halfway through or towards the end all right strap in and let's go the creator of this document I'm going to butcher his name Eric nooski now his agency is the one that does the cold Outreach for instantly AI clay and even clickup and he is a fake Guru and this video is going to expose him just kidding Eric is actually a friend and when I asked him to make this video and to share the resource with my my community he wanted to make sure that this wasn't going to be a tear down video and that I was going to be nice so I had to have some fun with him thank you Eric on a serious note Eric is one of the few people in this industry that I respect a lot and I hope that this video breakdown does him Justice here is Eric with his instantly AI plaque I have one just like it to prove that we are the real deal this is the top cold email experts in the game that you are learning from now let's dive into the document did anyone know what tldr means it's a too long didn't read so if you don't want to read the rest of the document he put together a nice breakdown of what you're going to learn right here so let me just go over kind of what the essence of this is going to be before we get into the nitty-gritty if you're going to just stop now and watch this part and then leave and go do something else then this is going to probably give you a lot of information get an instantly your smart lead account these are still the two best performing Platforms in fact I use both of them both with extraordinary results buy inboxes through their done for you setup I don't agree with that the reason I don't agree with that is even though they do have a good infrastructure that they set it up with you're locked there so if you ever want to move those mailboxes you're not really allowed to do that and you don't really have mailbox support I do recommend using my mailbox setup service you get a dedicated mailbox manager it's cheaper and you can move them between different Services if you decide to switch from instantly to Smart lead you own the mailboxes listen to their guidelines on warmup and sending at the time of this writing warm up for 3 weeks and send 30 emails per day per mailbox um as you'll learn throughout this video I disagree a little bit on those ranges honestly nobody knows the exact numbers here so this is what works for him so this is what you can do as well now Eric says Apollo is a great place to initially pull lists but they have the export limit so he uses clay to pull the leads and then email finding tools to enrich the leads I actually disagree here if you're going to take away anything from my advice at the beginning here I use trusted leads here to do Mass export from Apollo so you go into Apollo you create a filter link copy that filter link put it into trusted leads and they can export hundreds of thousands of leads for you all at once and then you can do whatever you want with them import them into clay put them into instantly uh but it saves you having to do all this extra step and will also save you a lot of money verifier leads with a third party tool before sending to keep balce rate low yes um as you all know I work use million verifier it's cheap it works fast it's good they have good good apis but it really doesn't matter which verification tool that you use and then he goes into when writing emails start with this four sentence framework honestly I don't even want you to focus on this right now because we go so deep in this video on copyrighting Frameworks and specific tactics that this is just not going to do the video Justice I will call out one thing here he says in the first sentence you should say why are you reaching out and why now I actually don't like that I know my way is a little bit sketchier I consider that first sentence the preview text it's what they're going to see before they open the email and you don't want them to think that you're being pitched before they open the email your goal number one is get them to open the email and the way to do that is to make the subject line in the first sentence of the email sound like it could be for from a friend or a colleague but we're going to get a lot deeper into that in just a second here all right email deliverability 101 now as you can see highlighted a bunch of stuff I marked this up so you're going to get my document which is his cloned with all my notes if you just hang in here uh and take the lessons that we're about to go over so email deliverability 101 he's using Google Microsoft hyper tide superwave mailboxes I am also using Google and Microsoft through hyper tide so hyper tide is a solution where they use Microsoft Enterprise accounts and they set up hundreds of Microsoft mailboxes each sending two to three emails per day they import those into smart lead right now smart lead is the only one that can handle those being imported and it works really well uh we've been running those for about 6 months now with awesome deliverability but most of our infrastructure is built on Google workspace I don't have any experience with superwave but from my knowledge they do exactly what hyper tide does but hyper tide I'm a little bit more loyal to now let's talk about email deliverability I really liked what he said here email deliverability is only a problem when people are marking you as spam all of this section could be ignored if no one was marking you as spam knowing these things is important but you could get away with sending cold emails from a MailChimp account every day if your offer was so good no one marked you a Spam really important insight there that the reason cold email is so hard to continuously hit the inbox is because people don't want to be emailed by you so they're marking you as spam so anything you can R do to reduce your spam count and your spam percentage is going to fix all of your deliverability issues no matter what your infrastructure is set up with infr mail mail Forge gole Google Microsoft if no one's reporting you as spam you're good now the question is how can you decrease that spam count as low as possible or offset it with good warming practices and that's what we're going to be talking about as well so in this section he talks a little bit about private SMTP servers in the infrastructure he says that they've tried the private smtps in the past and they work well if you have a low enough spam rate these are services like infr ma or mail Forge or all of the other ones that are popping up they use private IP addresses like Amazon web services accounts to spin up mailboxes and they can deliver really well at first but eventually if enough people mark them as spam they have a much lower threshold for spam before they all start failing that's why I left this comment here this is why beginners should not use private smtps you should always stick to Google and Microsoft now here Eric talks about scaling with Google and Outlook you need to scale the volume horizontally here's what it means to scale horizontally so say you send 30 to 50 emails per day per mailbox and you want want to send more do you increase that number from 50 to 100 no we add more mailboxes we scale horizontally those more mailboxes are then going to increase the overall sending volume now I want to preface this with nobody has the right answer for how many emails to send per day per mailbox it's not disclosed anywhere there's just generally accepted Norms so what Eric says his Norms are are two inboxes per domain warmed the domain for 3 weeks started sending 30 emails per day and when they knew they had a good campaign they can scale all the way up to 50 emails per day now I do it a little bit differently I actually set up five inboxes per domain and I only send 20 to 25 emails per mailbox but again everybody does this a little bit differently I also like to warm for at least 4 weeks that also means I get to warm my domain for four weeks and domain age is a really important factor nowadays and he kind of talks about this here why two instead of three really there's no proof he just knows that two or three is better than putting 10 inboxes on One domain and that remains to be true you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket if you put 20 mailboxes on a single domain sure it's a little bit easier to set up you save some money on domains but if that domain gets blacklisted all 20 mailboxes are now in the in the gutter so now in this section it kind of breaks down the difference between instantly and smart lead and I go back and forth on this too and I I use both platforms and both of them work pretty equally well but I really like the the analogy that he used instantly is like an iPhone smart lead is like an Android there's a lot more that you can do with smart lead especially if you know how to use the custom apis however I still prefer instantly and I think that they're innovating in a better rate instantly still does some things that smartly does not do that I think are super helpful one of them is the premium warm-up pool which I am in on instantly and two is the inbox placement tests on instantly and automatically taking those mailboxes in and out of rotation as the sending percentage in inbox gets better or worse really important feature that smartly does not currently have and instantly API has gotten a lot better so for example I've built a reply bot using make.com actually here's a little preview of it that reply bot uses instant's API so it pulls in recent messages and threads uh and I'm able to generate and send replies from instantly so important note here about the future of cold email and deliverability he kind of talks about the reason we don't use MailChimp or Constant Contact to send cold emails it's pretty obvious when you're sending cold emails based on the messaging that you're sending and the spam rate that you're typically getting with cold emails if MailChimp detects that then they're going to just boot you off the platform they don't have any tolerance for it however Google and Outlook know that we're sending cold emails but they seem to tolerate it and that remains to be true but they are making it more difficult for cold emailers and a really important point that Eric brings up here he says it's no secret we are cold emailing people either for instantly in smart lead we ow off into the platform if Google wanted to shut down cold email tomorrow they absolutely could I agree and disagree there there are some cold email platforms that don't use the oo connection like quick mail but it's a dead giveaway that we're using those Gmail inboxes for cold email especially because the oaf authentication code is the same instantly gives us the code we put it in the the Google workspace and now they know that we're connected to instantly so I think that might be something that could change over the next year or so something to look out for and something that the platforms will have to do to adapt some other important notes about infrastructure here he says make sure to buy domains that are separate from your main domain this is because no matter how good your email campaign is you're going to get people to mark you as spam and if you send emails from your main domain you're going to risk your regular Communications with your sales team with your customers with your vendors going to spam as well this is actually something that happened to Us in 2023 at no fault of my own but it was detrimental to our business it was horrible and it took a long time to come off of that Blacklist next team mentions that you need to set up the SPF dkim and Demar record and a custom tracking domain if you want to track open rates now we still set up our custom tracking domains even though we're not tracking open rates and we're not using unsubscribed links so theoretically that custom tracking domain is doing zilch but it's just part of our process we set it up just in case we ever do want to track opens we have that custom tracking domain in place to do it Eric mentions that he does not track open rates we are also not tracking open rates we use reply rate as a proxy for how many of these are getting delivered but it does kind of suck not to know what your open rate is but at the same time it's not worth the risk to deliverability to know your open rate it's just not now important Point here about your initial setup of the infrastructure he says he has 50% of his sending capacity in extra inboxes so if anything goes wrong with the first ones you can just rotate the bad ones out and the good ones in so we absolutely do this we set up way more mailboxes than we need for ourselves and for clients and now with instantly AI new placement test and mailbox rotation so now instantly can automatically take them out when those mailboxes start to go into spam warm them and then put them back in once they're hitting the inbox again it's one of the most powerful features instantly is ever built in and it makes doing this much easier and you don't even have to think about it inbox isn't performing well it automatically comes up it warms up it's off The Blacklist it goes back in it's unbelievably helpful and I recommend everybody turns that on now in addition to swapping inboxes he also says change the copy and pull a new list so it is totally possible that copy can be burned we have seen specific phrases used in cold emails trigger an email to go to spam so if you see an entire campaign drop off and it's not due to the mailboxes try and change up all the copy try and ident identify that phrase and try and pull a new list so now Eric talks a little bit about don't people think I'm a spammer if I'm sending an email to them from a different domain or a domain that's radically different than my actual email well he says this is okay and he's still forwarding all of his secondary cold email domains to his primary domain and we're still doing this too we buy lots of domains we they are similar to our primary domain just so there's some kind of brand recognition and continuity there so when they click on it it does go to the right place and right content I'm not a huge fan of using generic domains or radically different domains I think it adds a lot of confusion when you eventually do that handoff to the actual company with the actual domain so there was a section on domain masking proxies in here uh this is a video I did about email guard and domain masking proxies so that you don't have to forward a secondary domain to a primary domain uh and he did say that there was no evidence that this was an important factor and causing negative issues and I agree with him we're using domain masking proxies for about half of our cold email domains and the other half are still forwarding to a primary domain there has been no evidence that one performs better than the other just like oaf this this is just another potential issue down the road if Google decides we don't like cold email and this is one of the risk factors that we're going to look for and check that box this is suspicious that's definitely one of them so if if we do want to keep cold emailing in the well into the future we need need to anticipate these things and domain masking proxies is one of those Solutions I believe all right let's talk a little bit about list building so if the lead is on LinkedIn Apollo is a great place to get that list but they have export limits according to Eric we totally get around this by using trusted leads. uh they typically send the data within a couple hours it's it's verified they can even verify it from million verifier for you and just to show you what that looks like how easy it is you just come in here buy verified emails uh how many leads you want to scrape you can scrape multiple URLs verify the leads you can put the Apollo link to scrape right in here you can even use signals and Technologies and then they just scrape and send you the data within a couple of hours and it's fresh it's great and it gets around all of those issues with Apollo export limits so what he's doing is he builds the list in Apollo and then he uses clay for the list pulling my suspicion is that Eric has a a really good deal with clay and maybe gets unlimited credits and can use their M tools for free but for a lot of people Clay is a really expensive way to pull lead data so I recommend using trusted leads now important note here he says I don't care who is telling us the email is valid you still run the emails through a verification tool you always double verify your leads so if you're pulling it from Apollo and you have the verified check mark checked does that mean they're verified no not really you still need to run that list through million verifier or a verification platform of your choice honestly it doesn't doesn't really matter we have been using million verifier for years uh mostly because we can buy credits in the millions and you get millions of free credits so it's the most cost effective and they do a really good job at quick turnarounds and the output file always is really good and clean mentions Ron on appsumo that's pretty much always on appsumo it's an email verification platform so if you don't really have any money and you're just getting started uh that could be a good place to start head to appsumo and you can you can grab that now this one's important if your companies that you're trying to Target are not on LinkedIn this is like local businesses mom and pop Spas mechanic shops they're probably on Google Maps so Eric recommends using D7 lead finder which I've used it's a great tool or you can scrape Google Maps directly with appify I personally love appify but if I need lead data from Google Maps I'm typically going to be using lead Swift I just like the speed and way that you they organize the leads so lead Swift is kind of my go-to for scraping Google Maps uh and the reason for it let me just show you how cool it is here's a recent scrape that we did so not only does it scrape all of their details but I can come into this filter and I can really narrow down on the pain points that I'm trying to solve so website not working if I'm a website development agency and I want to Target local clients like this is a gold mine for scraping Google Maps if I'm a reputation management company I can come in here and say Google reviews less than four and now I'm only finding companies that have low Google reviews and it's really cheap really easy to use highly recommend this tool and by the way guys if you are curious what tools what Tex stack that I use in my scraping into my agency I do have this resource that it's available for you for free down in the description it's just got links to all of the softwares that I use a lot of them give me discount codes to share with my my community that are exclusive to me so definitely pop in here just to see kind of what I use for what all right now let's talk about some cold email copywriting some of the stuff that he talks about I'm a big fan of some of it I disagree with uh but let's jump right in and see what Eric has to say first let's start with a breakdown of his General framework I also love his humility he's like I'm not a master copywriter check these guys out uh so feel free to check those guys out but here's the general framework that Eric typically use for clients first sentence why are you reaching out and why now second sentence explaining how you can help third sentence build social proof fourth sentence is your call to action ask them if they're interested and want to take the next step I also love what he says here by the way a lot of people overthink all of this stuff if you follow these instructions the instructions set forth in the instantly and smart lead platforms for email deliverability and you write concise copy you're 90% of the way there and this is true once you get the infrastructure figured out and infrastructure is never been easier I'll set up the mailboxes and domains for you and put them into here instantly and warm them how much easier does it get than that now all you have to think about is who am I going to email and what am I going to say and that's really what the rest of this document is about uh and that's where the magic happens that's where the tactics are and hopefully you'll get some ideas for how you can build your own cold email campaigns from what Eric does from his clients and from the tactics that he's about to share all right hitting again on email deliverability he says 30 emails per day per mailbox with a 10-minute delay between emails that's something that hasn't come up yet you want this to feel and feel human so we usually do a 7-minute delay with a 5 minute variable this allows some variation so it seems a little bit more human two inboxes per domain we're we're now doing up to five warm up for 3 weeks we're now doing up to four but again there's there's no set limits here if you stay somewhere within the ranges of what he recommends and what I recommend you're probably going to be okay as long as you're not getting reported as spam all right now let's talk a little bit about the math and the infrastructure of the initial setup of a cold email system so it really comes down to a math equation we estimate how many emails per day a customer is going to be sending and we s set up three or four iterations of that volume so he says if someone wants to send 1,000 emails per day help prepare the ability to send 4,000 emails per day and splits them into batches batch one is regular Google batch two is hyper tide batch three are more Google inboxes batch for our superwave inboxes I think this is a little too complex and convoluted for most people I would say if you want to send 1,000 emails per day have the sending capacity for 2,000 but you can do it all in Google mailboxes Google is still the highest performing and it just keeps your life much much easier now here's what I do agree with let's say we don't burn the inboxes and the offer does work well so you have a campaign it's performing well it's been a month or two and you don't see a bunch of domains going to a blacklist now it could be time to add in additional mailboxes so this is when you could add in hyper tide or superwave mailboxes these are Microsoft mailboxes and now you can take advantage of email service provider matching this is something that might give you a one or two % boost in the overall performance of The Campaign it is not a huge movement maker but it is something that you can take advantage of and there is a slight Improvement if you do the provider matching and for those of you that don't know what provider matching is that's when you have a bunch of Google and Microsoft mailboxes in the same sending pool it will automatically match the Google to the Google the Microsoft to the Microsoft and you will get a slight Improvement of deliverability and reply rates I love the humility here too he said people ask all the time about coaching for email deliverability it really doesn't get much more complicated than this when when things go wrong and you really have to diagnose and fix it can be tough to get answers email deliverability in general is relatively simple now just some things that I want to add that Eric actually didn't seem to touch on in this was open tracking and unsubscribe links we're not using any code at all in our cold emails so no unsubscribe links no open tracking we're sending us plain HTML we're not even adding a PS if you want to opt out say stop or anything like that uh our goal is to make it feel like a friend sending an email to a friend anytime you add tracking code or unsubscribe links even though Google said we needed it to send cold emails early in 2023 that was not true once we removed all of the open tracking and unsubscribed links we saw our deliverability Skyrocket and since then it's been light years better than than it ever was in the past now I am skipping over some stuff because it's not all fully relevant to to everyone and a lot of it gets really nitty-gritty uh into the weeds that I don't think you need for the purpose of this video it's going to be long enough as it is but if you want this document with all of my comments and highlighted notes go to the link leadjen j.com Eric I C and it's going to take you right to this Google doc no optins no nothing just thank you for watching this far and I hope this document serves you some good now let's talk about some more advanced stuff ESP matching this is service provider matching that we just talked about he says that it does have an effect but it's a minor effect and just breaking it down the philosophy as why it works Google receives emails better from Google and Outlook receives better from Outlook so if you match them your deliverability rates go up this is true but again barely we've seen maybe a 2 to 3% increase when adding provider matching it is not the end of the world spin tax Eric actually says it is not that important and I think that's because he's using AI heavy in all of his email campaigns which most people are not not so if you're varying the the copy that's going out with every email you're probably not going to burn through copy and you're probably not going to need to use the spin tax spin tax is the process of adding multiple synonyms or phrases into copy so that an email service provider sees the variation in the messaging we actually use a lot of spin taxs I actually built a GPT to help me write spin taxs that uses phrases and words that don't trigger spam it works really well and I'm actually a big supporter of spin tax especially if you use it wisely and correctly okay awesome here's where he talks about domain masking says it's very new he almost didn't include it and they are not currently using it he says that he's seen very smart people talking about it and claiming it makes a difference to be clear they've never used it and they would like to see some more data before implementing it and I think by very smart people Eric is actually talking about me because I did make a video talking about it and how we were going to start using it but I do want to agree with Eric in that the evidence does not show me it makes a difference yet we're seeing absolutely zero difference just like we're seeing Zero difference in performance between instantly and smart lead the domain masking proxies are not making a difference they're not hurting but they're definitely not helping all right talking about spam tests like Glock apps or smart delivery these are tools that allow you to send emails to a seed list of inboxes these are inbox placement tests when we're talking about these types of span tests we're talking about inbox placement tests meaning it's sending an actual email to 10 to 20 mailbox es across different providers Yahoo Google Microsoft Google personal G suite and it's seeing how that email actually delivers to that mailbox does it go to spam is it flagged these tools and these reports will tell you whether or not that's true now I used to advise people to use all kinds of different tools for this Glock apps war me. and lately email guard since instantly AI has released their inbox placement test with the automation that is the only thing that we're using and I don't foresee a world in which we ever go back to a different tool just because the it can automatically take inboxes in and out of rotation which is just so goddamn valuable but it looks like Eric is not currently doing that uh they're still using these tests to get an idea of where inboxes are landing but I also know that Eric is mostly using smart lead and smart lead has not yet implemented this to the level that instantly AI has although I'm sure they're going to be rolling that out any day so he says something important here about expectations when you're looking at these different tests and results so you can do one of these mailbox placement tests and you can see three blacklists on your domain and five blacklists on your mailbox IP address does that mean that you should take it out of rotation and stop sending no I I would not say so I'd say the only metric that matters to me is if it's delivering to the inbox I don't care as much about Blacklist the question is are the blacklists causing my email not to hit the inbox if not take it out of rotation and warm it until the Blacklist lifts he says that the most important metric we look through is if the campaign is getting around a 1% reply rate excluding out of office messages and I love the humility here too there's a lot of success pouring on instantly people getting 20 30% reply rates this is a realistic number to shoot for with most clients and most campaigns so next we talk briefly about catch all domains for those that don't know yes chat GPT and we found a catch all domain accepts all emails even for non-existent addresses this makes it tough to validate because you can't tell specific email is valid or just being caught by the domain it requires extra checks Beyond standard validation that's why most email validation platforms like million verifier don't really verify catchalls there's new platforms that do but they take so long that they're barely even usable I'll talk a little bit about those in a in a minute and I thought this was interesting uh there are catchall email verification tools that say they can verify catchall and here's how they do it I actually didn't know this so this was a learning point for me they're checking to see if you can log into the email address if the email doesn't exist it won't pass the screen so if you're trying to validate a g Suite Gmail using one of these catchall verification Services it'll actually type it into Google and try and log into that mailbox if it can't find the email account it does not pass the catchall verification so what do you do with all that information do you still send to catchalls do you send them to a verification platform and wait well uh we're doing a little bit different things Eric is not sending to catchalls for now I am actually sending to catchalls but I am sending them all to mail verify. a first here's what that looks like so this is mail verify. and here's an example of what some of the results look like so I actually send them to mail verify from a clay API Automation and then if they're valid I'll then put them back into rotation it's a lot of work and probably too much for most people it only might make sense to do that if you have a really small total addressable Market to verify the catchalls if you have a giant total addressable Market it might make more sense just to not send to catch all email addresses so lessons from bounces I'm just going to read what he said here in the past 6 months bounce rates have really increased on our campaigns they've started double verifying leads to fight against it but they remain high bounces happened for two reasons one because the email doesn't exist or two the email you're trying to send an email to thinks you're a spammer now I get this question all the time too Jay we verified our leads with million verifier we're still getting a ton of bounces what's going on it's not cuz the email's not valid it's because the copy is wrong or the recipient thinks you're a spammer so if this is the case do what Eric says to do here which is drastically change your copy and swap your inboxes to see if you start to see a decrease in those bounces I also really like what he says here final check on anything that is questionable to be validated by instantly verification so instantly actually has the benefit of sending Millions probably tens or hundreds of millions of emails per day so they know what emails are actually bouncing if you verify with instantly verification service they will actually use that data to remove those historic bounces from your list so if you can afford to pay the extra for instantly to verify your leads you should definitely do it all right this section is a lot of fun this is experiments Eric tested One Thing versus the other things that were all curious about things that I'm curious about and I was very excited to see some of the results and here they are instantly versus smart lead I know everyone wants to know which one is better and why he did a test where he took the exact same inboxes and connected them to Smart lead and instantly and got the exact same reply rate and positive reply rate across five different campaigns we did a near identical test to this and got pretty much the same results so is one better than the other yes I think instantly is better specifically because of the premium warm-up pool and Auto automatic placement tests with automatic mailbox rotation I think that's going to take them light years ahead but I'm sure smart lead is not that far behind and by the way guys if you don't have a subscription to instantly yet please sign up using my affiliate link it's going to be linked down below or in this document um I do get a little bit of a kickback from them but it is a platform that I utilize myself I love it and I I really support it and you using my affiliate link supports my channel so this is a really interesting test Eric wanted to see if he crank the sending volume of a single Google mailbox all the way up to 1,000 emails per day what would happen well a lot of you don't know but they're not actually capped at 50 or 100 emails per day for regular Google mailboxes they can actually send up to 2,000 per day most people don't do that because it's not likely to work for a long period of time but what he did is he cranked it to 1,000 per day per mailbox and checked it the next day and it was still Landing in the inbox so the takeaway there was that it's not about how many emails per day that mailbox sends it's about the percentage of people marking you as spam and the more cold emails you send from a mailbox the higher percentage of spam complaints you're going to get and the chance of that mailbox getting blacklisted or the domain getting blacklisted is much higher but if you've got a rock solid campaign and no one's reporting you as spam you could theoretically crank the volume of each mailbox infinitely up to a th000 or 2,000 emails per day so his takeaway from this was they'll ramp up emails sent per mailbox above 30 per day and sometimes even even push to 60 but 30 is usually their starting place and I left a comment here that there really is no perfect answer about how many emails per day it's the ratio of spam complaints so some important notes about the future of email deliverability these are some of his hypothesis when it comes to email thinks warm-up copy ooth masking and domain age are going to be some of the most important things to start implementing I totally agree especially ooth masking which is changing the ooth code code that you put into your Google workspace to authenticate instantly to connect right now everyone's getting the same one to mask instantly or smart lead you would need different ooth codes domain age is already super important for Outlook deliverability and I think will continue to be more and more important and then warm-up copy so he spend some time down here talking about warm-up copy and I think it might just be worth reading the way email warm-up works today is you join a pool of other inboxes and they'll automatically email each other and respond to each other now the text being sent in the email warmup is usually AI generated to keep varying the copywriting in the emails now back in the day the first warm-up tools were're actually sending random paragraphs from books back and forth to each other thinks it's going to be even more important now to vary that email copy to use Ai and to send copy similar to what you're actually going to be sending in your main campaign and I totally agree with this and that's where the more premium warm-up tools are going like warmy doio they have a a feature where you can actually choose your offer and it the warm-up copy is going to be with that offer so that when you start actually sending real emails that way say you select SEO services that way when you start cold emailing for SEO Services it's not a big surprise because that SEO copy is already warm talking more about the ooth masking basically breaking down what I just told you now domain age Eric is doing something really interesting here that I'm cons considering doing for ourselves so they currently have 2500 inboxes warming at all times and they're using generic domains they're doing this because they're prioritizing domain age over domain relevancy and I don't necessarily disagree with this however if you're working with a client and you're sending emails on their behalf you might not want that domain to be different now there's definitely a perk to to doing this with age domains which is that you don't have to warm them they're already warm this is what instantly AI offers already in their service so it could be something worth looking into but if you have the time I think it might be worth finding a similar enough domain and this is an important thing to keep in mind for those of you that think that cold email is extinct in 2025 it's always going to be a viable Channel and there's always going to be a battle between people like me and Eric against Google and Microsoft Google and Outlook can't make their own spam filters so tight that regular users can't use them and you have to keep this in mind when we're thinking long term it's going to be just fine they can't make the spam filter so tight that it's unusable and we will find ways to get around any measures that they put up and I like what he says here it's going to be a cat Mouse game of lowering the volume per inbox increasing the warm-up time and making it harder for Google and Outlook to know where your emails are automatically being sent from finally an important note and an easy way to think about not Landing in spam I'm going to run through these important points because he made them bold so I'm going to also treat them as bold do the opposite of what a spammer does spammer send thousands of emails in one day from one domain don't do that spammers use cheap SMTP servers with bad security spammers buy a domain and use it immediately spammers don't validate their lists so they can keep their bounce count down spammers send emails baiting people to click on links spammers use Spam keywords like free and guarantee you can easily Google a list of spam keywords and spammers do not warm up their domains all right now talking a little bit about data Eric did make this public data pipeline sop available it's going to be available to you inside of this document at Le nj.com Eric now here are some important findings and for people that don't do a lot of cold email this is going to be a really helpful hint for you seite still responds the most often probably because they're most open to new ideas and creating change in the organization we typically only contact seite unless we're going really really high employee counts HR and software Engineers never respond to email now this is an important Insight that most cold emailers know but if you're new and you're like I should contact HR or a software engineer don't bother it's not going to work now in 2024 the email waterfall became more popular uh this is something that clay uses to try and find somebody's email by going from source to source and seeing if they can uncover it from one provider or another Apollo is now building this into their platform too and it's a really sexy idea uh and I actually really like what Eric said about this although he uses it and and I use it as well in clay it's really not that helpful and I've no noticed that too especially because of all of the catchall email addresses if Apollo doesn't have it the chances of one of these other providers having it is like 1 in 10 now that 1 in 10 is going to give you an extra person to reach out to but sometimes it's not worth the squeeze sometimes it's worth just ignoring that one and moving on and if you're interested in learning more about how that works just check out the clay section inside of my program now I really like Eric's insights into list building and I think this is somewhere where people need to spend a lot of time and energy and that is honing in on the exact right person that you should be reaching out to and acknowledging that no data source is perfect when it comes to segmenting based on keywords or industry or job title it never hits 100% so your job is to work that list adding in excluding keywords adding in excluding Industries same thing with job titles until you can look at 20 leads on that list and say that's a good person that's a good person and maybe one or two of them are not but it will never be perfect so what he says here is that every list has a problem it is hard to get an entire list of the perfect ICP and the comment that I left is it's it's not a perfect science but it is an art and a science at the same time and you can use tools like clay to qualify these leads and the way that I typically do that is add a step that does Research into the company and decides whether or not they're a good fit for my offer that's using a clent Automation and again if you're interested in clay that will be inside of my program and hopefully some upcoming YouTube videos now I highlighted this one if you get two exclusive now you're missing companies that you should probably reach out to so if you get way too narrow and for example you only want it to show keywords that have public relations agency yeah you're probably only going to get public relations agencies but you're going to be missing half of the pr agencies that are available to you so sometimes it's better to keep it relatively loose and good enough now we are doing an advanced clay training inside of my program but if you're interested in learning clay Eric is probably the best on YouTube at teaching clay he doesn't hold anything back he's just like me so if you want to run through his videos that he's already done uh crawl walk run this is like beginner medium Advanced you can go through some of these and and learn how it works and I highly recommend that you do that got your back Eric all right now we're diving into campaign strategy so he breaks this down into three parts how can we get someone to respond how can we get someone to book a meeting and then how do you get them to convert into to customers I wanted to add one more piece to that puzzle which is how to get someone to open your email I think that's an important part that can't be overlooked especially while we're not tracking open rates we need to be sure that somebody is opening our email and if we ignore that then our apply rates and everything else is going to suffer now important note as we're breaking this down into three or four steps that most of this is going to be focused on step number one which is how to get people to open and respond to your email everything after that is sales and it has to do with your offer and your processes and it's not really going to be a topic for this video all right so when you're running a campaign what should you really be reaching for what's a reasonable expectation for reply rate opportunity rate well now we're going to break that all down Eric believes the max response rate of a campaign is 30% and gives some really compelling evidence as to why now I don't know if this is going to help you a ton but I I was very entertained by these tests so I think you'll find some entertainment in them too they tried to maximize the reply rate possible from a cold email campaign and to do that they implemented some strategies that I thought would be like a 100% reply rate uh so here's what they did the first one they sent an email that said hey I saw you help people and then some generated Way by AI my friend's looking for help in that can you confirm that's what you do and I can connect you so basically handing somebody a client now if you got that email and someone's like are are you a PR agency I have someone looking for that can I connect you of course you're going to say yes you're going to reply and he thought it would be 40 50 60% but it was actually only a 10% response rate from an email campaign literally handing somebody a client test number two someone wanted to come up with a similar plan so they devised an experiment where they emailed people basically saying hey I have a gift for you can you confirm your address and I'll put it in the mail tomorrow but then they sent the address they had on file and they purposely made the company address off by 10 numbers so if the real address was 100 Park AV the email would say 110 Park AV so if someone sending you a gift and you don't want to pick it up from your neighbor's house should respond right well that one got an 11% response rate so here's the third example 3 days before a conference and they knew who was speaking so they asked in the cold email hey do you want to be interviewed by Forbes in the Forbes booth at the conference you'll for sure be at in 3 days 30% response rate but all positive so this is the takeaway from this lesson when people are posting campaigns that are going gang busters they have 30 to 40% reply rates he does exactly what I do and I left a comment here is I bring them on to my show and I interview them about those campaigns I want to know what they're doing to generate those results and it's usually one of these two situations the campaign is either to a super Niche list to an event coming up and they'll never be able to run that campaign again or they're giving away something for free that's a no-brainer so for most cold email campaigns this is the normal humans what should you expect as a result what is a good positive reply rate what is a reply rate you should you should be aiming for so Eric's average across all of his customers is that they get one positive response for every 350 contacts they reach out to and I did the math that is a 0.3% opportunity rate and this is typically for a competitive or a saturated offer and this can be a good number to aim for for most companies and most offers if you're an AI chat bot or an SEO agency you're going to have a hard time going gang busters in a campaign so if you get a 1% opportunity rate that's massive you scale that that's a that's a great result so the moral of the story here is set your expectations realistically and that's what the pros get so if you're getting around that you're probably doing a good job all right so now diving into copywriting again he doesn't pretend to be an expert here and links to a cold email copyrighting course that you can buy here and actually checked it out it's only a couple hundred bucks I might pick it up never done it myself there's only five offers in the world you can help people save time save money make more money raise their status or live longer I really like the way that he framed that and it actually translates really well to cold email because there's really only so much you can do with cold email copyrighting now I made a lot of notes here this was a pretty in-depth section there's a lot of tactics and specific examples of tactics that you can use in here so feel free to stop go back rewind freeze it take a screenshot or have the document open next to me as I'm talking through some of these things so that you can really internalize it and learn it cuz this is really where the magic happens infrastructure is easy building a list isn't that hard what you say is arguably the hardest thing and this is going to be diving into what you actually say in that cold email sequence so let's dive in the subject line we're in agreement on what he says here two to three words that a customer or colleague could have reasonably sent I want to spend a couple minutes just adding my own two cents there you don't want your prospect to know that it's a cold email before they open the email if it says quick question or company name-- your name or quick meeting I know I'm about to be cold emailed I delete that thing or if I know I'm about to open a cold email I won't open it I actually have a folder that I drag them to that reverse pitches them via a make automation that's really cool and available inside of my program but the subject line in essence should be something that a friend or a colleague could have sent that makes you wonder all right I need to open that because I'm not quite sure what's inside but it still needs to be relevant to the content of that email uh and I'll explain as we get a little bit deeper he says to always test against the tried and true so question for first name uh company name your company even the dreaded quick question these are the tactics that used to work really well in 2023 we don't use them at all anymore so here's an area I disagree with him he says the first line should be why you why now explain why you're reaching out and why now I disagree with this and I think that first line is something that they can see before they open the email so if you come at me and you're like hey I'm I'm Jay I've run a PR agency and I want to help you get featured in this thing I know it's a cold email it goes into the folder I don't open it you really need to bait me into opening in the email and I I love receiving cold emails I really do I'm a connoisseur I will open a good one and respond to a good one but bad ones go straight into the folder and a subject line like that automatically goes into the folder so he also says the first line is a good place for the AI generated sentence uh and I don't disagree with that uh especially if you can add something personalized but it has to sound like it could be from a colleague or a client has to the second line he says poke the bear or explain your offer agitate their pain points by asking a question about how they do things or jump into how you can help yes I agree with this 100% here and there's different ways that you can frame your offer and different pain points that you could be poking at so as you're doing your split tests test those different pain points test those different agitations and you're going to see the needle move with some of those variations third line share a case study of how you helped someone else so love this if you have a good relevant case study use it if you don't then there's other ways to build your credibility but you should know that you only have one or two lines to build some credibility here so if you want an award better be a good one if you're featured in a Forbes article better be a good one if you're a social media influencer this is where I might build some credibility by saying hey I'm Le genj I've got you know 50k Subs on YouTube this doesn't have to be sharing a case study it could just be establishing some sort of social proof finally the fourth line is a call to action do something and then some people use a PS some people don't this is a pretty good structure overall uh and I had mostly good things to say about it now the framework is a guideline but we found that the best possible thing that you can do is keep your email short he says under 100 words 75 is even better I agree you don't want long lengthy emails it actually can work in certain industries and demographics that's probably for another day but if you're emailing like doctors and you want to give them all the information in one shot sometimes that actually works really well but in most cases keep it real short really to the point now I love this so I want to read it to you if you use this framework combined with changing around how you communicate your offer you can easily get 3 to seven campaign tests going just shaking up how communicate saving time saving money and making more money for your customers and he gives some really good examples here so this is where I might recommend actually opening up this document and and doing it with me leadjen j.com Eric it'll open right up you'll have all these notes and you can follow along so this is what we mean when we say communicating your offer differently if you're trying to get them on making more money do you have a plan to build your pipeline with such a lean team so this is really hitting on their interest to to make more money they need to build a pipeline that same email could be flipped around to help them save money so maybe that person's really interested in Saving reducing costs so in this example you could say have you thought about outbound automation so you can save money from hiring a team of sdrs so essentially the same offer just framed differently and then you can do the same thing to curate to someone who wants to save time do you have an outbound system running yet or are you looking to get started last week alone we helped company name validate that they could get leads with cold email by launching a free campaign for them on one 30-minute call so this is somebody whose time is really valuable you want to emphasize how quick it can be all right sequence length how many emails should you send in a single sequence now back in 2023 2022 we were actually doing like seven step sequences now we're keeping it really really short typically only two sometimes three so Eric says that the best performing emails are email 1 and two and if email 3 has a better response rate than one flip around and make it one if you have a large Tam Target addressable market then the best thing you can do is send short sequences if you send a two email sequence you can reach out to more people in a shorter period of time and this is stuff that Eric has tested and I've tested he says all of the other emails in the sequence have a massive drop off in response rate so anyone who says that they got Apple to respond and email 7even in the sequence that's typically only true because the priorities or something changed in the company during that time and for every one of those positive responses you probably have 10 spam complaints that could have been avoided by shortening your sequence so here Eric talks about reusing lists so you spent all this time building a really nice refined list maybe you've got 10,000 people in your target addressable market and you email that list it takes you 3 months should you email them again or can you is that even a viable option well the answer is yes people have a really short attention span so if you cold email me about editing my videos today and then 3 months later you send me another cold email about it I'm not going to remember that you emailed me the first time and if I do I'm not going to care maybe I do need a video editor 3 months from now so we like to recycle our lists every 3 to 6 months which is another reason to keep your sequences short because you can run through the list wait and then recycle that same list and Eric agrees here he says they often send shorter sequences when the Tam is large over 880,000 prospects and an important point he makes here follow-up is key in sales but not in outbound marketing the opport opportunity cost of following up with the same person over and over again versus finding someone new combined with the increased likelihood of someone marking you as spam or unsubscribing with each email in the sequence are the reasons that he wants to urge you not to send long sequences and I totally agree all right the sequence structure so in what order should you send these emails should it be in the same thread we talk about all of this right now email one this is the net new email you're initiating a new thread email 2 is going to be in the same thread as email 1 email three another a new email thread you're sending this not in the same thread with a different subject line and then email 4 will be in the same thread as email 3 if you use an email 4 and then some important reasons why they don't follow up in the same thread I thought this was really helpful it reminds the prospect that they already didn't respond to you all those other times so why would they respond to you this time it makes you sound desperate email one gets more positive responses than any other email so we're trying to replicate that on email 3 you want to see if they forgot about the other email and maybe something else came out of the blue and then email 2 is usually added on top of the context of email 1 and that'll be explained in just a second now the purpose of email one is to introduce the offer to the prospect they want to come armed with homework that we use to research them and explain why we're reaching out to them and most importantly explain why the email is worth their time to engage this is really where you throw most of your dice into the pot hopefully you've you've done some sort of research on that person you've HED in on the list and hopefully you've used something like CL to do the research and put together that AI personalization that's really going to help boost your campaign email one structure we've already talked about now for email 2 he uses this structure here starts with first name and then an AI generated line to make it a little bit more personal then he explains in more depth how we made that case study from email 1 possible and then a call to action similar to the first email now here's where we like to experiment a little bit sometimes we just add a bunch of like bullet points some people just need need more information about the offer before they take some sort of action so in email to sometimes we'll just explain everything about the offer that we didn't in email one and then sometimes we'll drop a calendar Link in email 2 so maybe they don't want to respond to book a meeting but maybe if we drop a calendar link a calendly link because they deliver really well they'll just go ahead and book all right now I really like how he frames email 3 so we talked about all those different ways you can communicate an offer and all of the different pain points that you could potentially draw out of somebody and and use to frame your offer in email 3 that's when you typically pull that out change the way you're framing the offer change the way you're communicating it and then lower the friction by changing your CTA so if you're asking for a meeting maybe you just try and get them to say yes to accept a lead magnet they've already ignored you your CTA was too much of an ask not enough value so try and offer more value and give them something in return So if we do an email 3 in any of our sequences this is when we'll typically drop a lead magnet for them or at least some sort of video or resource to provide some sort of value and that's essentially what he shares here inside of his email structure poke the bear differently new social proof and then CTA with a little bit lower of friction and then if you're using an email for he calls this a Hail Mary this is important he says break up emails get higher responses but you don't want to come off as desperate so we don't send breakup emails either the reason they work is because you're signaling you won't follow up again so if there's anybody on the list that was thinking about responding but was distracted this email is going to get them but I like what Eric does here this is his structure for an email FL here's how it goes Fred I know there's about 20 employees over at otter PR and perhaps SDR is not your responsibility should I reach out to Scott instead given their role instead of sending a traditional breakup email this is a good opportunity for them to actually point you in the right direction of somebody to reach out to so I actually like this as an email for and it's something that I'd like to to potentially Implement all right using your Tam this is kind of what we touched on earlier your target addressable Market the fact is that most businesses and offers don't have an infinite list to work off of even if you serve every B2B company in the country that's still only maybe a couple million so what do you do if you're scaling a campaign to a million emails a month you're going to run out of data so this kind of addresses how to handle that sort of situation especially with a smaller Tam so you don't have an infinite list to work off of if you scale up to 20K emails per day and your has 10K you're going to burn through your list every morning so here's the problems that you need to address you don't want to excessively email them and you want to keep getting positive responses here Eric just kind of talks about what I referenced earlier people have a short attention span you want to reuse those lists but you want to wait long enough for something to have changed in their business if you email them the same thing every week chances are it's not enough time for something to have changed and they're going to remember that you just emailed them about that thing that's when you start getting spam reports and you start to land on your list bad side Eric contacts the list every 3 months or more if the list is really small they want to space things so they contact them every 2 months at least as a minimum now the part that I love about cold email and this is my favorite thing when I'm pitching this as a way to generate leads and calls is it all comes down to a math equation if you can get a 1% opportunity rate which is really what I like to shoot for in my campaigns then it's all about how many leads do we need to Conta contact per day to get x amount of calls so he says here when he has a new client we first ask how many leads they can handle per month let's say it's 10 meetings a month it takes contacting 250 leads to get one positive response that means they need to send emails to roughly 2500 leads in order to get 10 meetings cold email is just a math equation and if you figure that out you're able to scale it to pretty much unlimited means and that's why it's been the main lead source for us for years all right guys I've now been recording the same video for an hour and a half straight of talking so if you appreciate me taking the time to do this for you and put this together I'd really appreciate you liking and subscribing to the channel uh I try and put out as much free stuff like this as possible this stuff really isn't easy to do cost a lot of money and time uh this is going to be like 3 days work so if you appreciate it I would appreciate a comment a like and a subscribe to the channel and if you didn't already know I do have a paid program where I go deep into cold Outreach and I also have other experts like Eric who's actually come in and done exclusive master classes within the community there's also unbelievable resources we build out your cold email machines write your copy give you access to 700 million leads there a lot of really cool stuff in there uh so definitely check it out the link is going to be down below this is an energy shooter called liquid focus with a little bit of caffeine to get me going through the rest of this now arguably the most fun part of this presentation is copyrighting levers so definitely pull this document up put it next to you go through this with me I highlighted some things that I think are going to be really valuable to you so you don't have to go through all 90 Pages a lot of people I work with will come to me and say we've got an unbelievable offer it's a no-brainer we've got an unbelievable lead magnet everybody's going to want this and they are wondering why it's not working and the answer is usually because there's some sort of implicit objection so when you're developing your copy you need to think what is this Prospect going to be going through in their mind to object to this email and to discredit it and here's some great ways to think about it how much time is it going to take to implement or switch so I have a a client I worked with who's trying to email people who are using Salesforce to switch their crms so of course it's going to save them a lot of money so he thinks it's a no-brainer offer but switching a CRM takes a lot of time to implement and switch and there's going to be a lot of Downstream negative effects another one how are you actually increasing sales so I hate when people get guarantee me sales or Revenue straight to the folder I would avoid it all together don't guarantee leads don't guarantee sales unless there's something really unique that you can prove that you can guarantee sales with but usually there's not is it really that much better so you think it's better but is it actually if it's better than what somebody's already using or better than all of the competitors that they know are in the market then you're going to have a hard time standing out and lastly who increased sales by 120% and are they anything like me this is where using a case study to a relevant client that you've worked with is is really important if the prospect you're emailing is nothing like your case study it doesn't really help so if you do face this issue and there's these implied objections maybe it's not actually better maybe the case study is different this is a strategy that you can use to combat that so he says I'd try messaging about all of these features but I'd bet money on the LinkedIn activity so what he's talking about here is a client who has a CRM and it does all this different stuff and he's pitching that CR CRM in a cold Outreach but there's one specific feature of that CRM that other crms don't have it's a specific paino that it solves and Eric is saying that you need to lead with that paino so instead of messaging about this big gigantic offering that can do all of these different things is there a way that you can Niche down your offer to only solve one specific pain point and differentiate yourself from all of the other agencies and tools and crms so find the one thing that makes you different the one pain point you can address and go in on that focus on that and that's pretty much the comment that I left here for Eric so lead magnets and front end offers if you're familiar with me and the channel you know I'm a huge fan of these we're actually using AI now to execute pretty much all of our front-end offers and Lead magnets and if you can learn how to use appify with a no code automation platform like make you'd be shocked at the things that you can build as lead magnets that require zero zero human intervention the people would actually pay for now Eric gives a great example here he often offers them a list of every person that's new in their role and in their industry now they built the ability to launch campaigns for people for free so they're leaning into that in 2025 you can do most of this now with no code automation so if I wanted to do this uh give them a list of every person that's new in their role in their industry I could build a make automation to put the the keywords together and then scrape LinkedIn jobs uh with appify and then feed it into a Google sheet and now I have that ready for them without any human intervention so there's a lot of really powerful lead Magics that you can build especially if you can make it work with scraping and copyrighting so just think about how you can get creative there and if you're interested in learning how to build those things insiders program that's my paid program that's where I teach all of those things and give you the blueprints to a lot of those automations that I build myself all right so love this pay attention so a front-end offer is something that's going to be disproportionately valuable to how much you charge for it so I have a couple good examples that I'll share with you I have a $97 offer where I build out an entire cold email system for somebody I write their copy I give them 10,000 custom leads that's scraped for them most of this is done with a VA and a little bit of Automation and Ai and it is disproportionately valuable other companies are charging thousands of dollars for the same type of cold Outreach system setup that I'm doing for $97 but nobody knows that on the back end of that offer I'm getting affiliate commission with instantly AI typically forever cuz I'm getting them onto that platform and I've got UPS sales on the back of that offer to join my insiders program and even for me to do a one-on-one High ticket buildout for them so even though it's 97 bucks I end up making a lot more and Eric uses a great example for list kit these are actually some friends they're in Tampa and they charge about $2,500 for a done for you setup that includes the email script the inboxes the first list and they set everything up for 2500 it's really really reasonable but the backend offer is that they actually sell the data so everybody signs up for that 2500 and then everybody that's on this setup is basically forced to buy the list kit data at a massive markup if you're comparing the list kit data versus using trusted leads it's like 100 to one but they get the setup now they're locked in the mailboxes are locked there their infrastructure is locked there and the only way to put data in is with list kit so you're on a subscription plan now that's a great front-end offer and they're making a ton of money on this my backend offer is actually similar to this uh for me it's 7500 uh I come on board with you we do the one-on-one buildout for you we give you all of the data we actually give you a Google Legacy account with all of the mailboxes their G Suite mailboxes already loaded in there so you don't have any mailbox fees ever we give you all of the data so now you have a system with all of the data already paid for all the mailboxes paid for and no mailbox fees forever we work with you until it's actually working it's more money but there's not a lot of backend retention it's more front-end so a lot of people will jump at the 97 oh yeah let's get it done really cheap and not realize that now they're going to have to keep buying leads they're going to have to keep paying for mailboxes but on the other side of that there's people who want to just pay the 7500 and get a machine that's working with not a lot of monthly maintenance fees and long-term fees and if you're interested in learning more about that offer you can come into Leen j.com machine and I actually have a like a 30 minute loom video where I break down all of the details to that offer so if you're watching this and you're like I just want you to build this for me and get it to work that's where you go Legion j.com machine and it's the only offer where you work with me one-on-one but just to bring it back to cold email into copywriting a frontend offer works really well in cold email it's actually what I use to generate leads with C email too that $97 offer converts really well with cold email but not just cold email it also converts well with paid ads with Google ads it's it's a it's a marketing Powerhouse and it feeds a lot of people into my system and it's a self-sustaining funnel so for paid ads I think I'm spending like $50 to acquire a customer via that $97 funnel and I make like $500 per client on that $97 funnel on average so if you don't already have a good front-end offer that's like that try and think of one they are very very useful now one final note about front-end offers is try and do something that nobody else can easily replicate so sending someone data it's okay sending someone a video it's okay but if you can do a service that would be really hard for somebody else to to replicate that's what's going to work best and if you think about Eric's front-end offer where he's going to launch an email campaign for you for free in 30 minutes I would have no idea how to replicate that offer so that's a really good front-end offer so think about that it's a little bit complicated it's a little bit Advanced but if you can figure that out you unlock unlimited Revenue okay important point about lead magnets I feel is worth mentioning don't spend a ton of time building a lead magnet that you're not sure is going to work you're probably wrong this is where testing and pulling your audience really comes in handy I can't tell you how many build outs I've done I'm like all right what do you have a lead magnet what is your lead magnet like yeah it's awesome we've got a white paper or we've got a demo call make sure that your lead magnet is actually something that your ICP wants and would even pay for and I left a comment here I said make sure that the the lead magnet idea is good validate it first and then you can use Ai and make.com and appify to deliver on that lead magnet and I like what Eric said here when you're delivering the lead magnet people make the common mistake of saying reply and I'll send it to you here's what he says instead of saying we have the form ready for you say something like it takes some time for me to pull from our database one by one but if I did would you be the right person on the team to share it with if it's truly valuable share with them why you can't give it to them right now and the reason you haven't done it already is because you want to make sure they're the ones to send it to I thought this was really insightful and a mistake that I've made as well we usually just say reply and I'll send it to you that degrades the value of the lead magnet so by flipping the script and saying I just want to make sure the right person before we expend resources delivering this lead magnet it actually pumps up the perceived value of that lead magnet so I think this is a really great idea so here's a point about lead magnets that I actually disagree with Eric says to keep in mind when creating a lead Magnet or front-end offer there's a path to revenue on the other side of it I don't necessarily think that every lead magnet needs to have a backend offer or needs to directly correlate to that final sale and he provides an example here of Zoom info putting out an ad to download a guide of how to cold text people compliantly and he downloaded it immediately but Zoom info tried to get him on a call and he they couldn't get him on a call so he says that was a bad lead magnet and front end offer I actually disagree I think that was a great lead magnet and front- end offer for them because it got Eric to raise his hand and said yeah I cold text people I'm a growth hacker uh and he would be theoretically a good client for Zoom info so they hit their target ICP correctly they got his email address now is everybody who downloads your lead magnet going to pay pay you no so that's kind of what I said here in the comment don't expect everybody you give a lead magnet to to convert but now it's open season on the selling process which is getting them to set an appointment and getting them to eventually convert and at this point they've already raised their hand and said yes I need help with that by them accepting the lead magnet that is what that is saying I need help with that now we talk a little bit about case study messaging so how do you actually frame your case studies and use your case studies when you're sending cold emails we talked about about this a little bit briefly but let me just read this to you be careful sometimes you need to test if it's worth naming the actual company you worked with if your case studies with Google and you're reaching out to small companies they're going to think wow they must be expensive but if your case study is too small the prospects might might not care and disregard it you should test dropping the quantitative results of the case study versus including the name and the results so to add my own bit of wisdom there is I like to segment my campaigns by industry and try and make sure that I have a good case study for that industry in that campaign so instead of sending the same case study to all the industries and job titles and Company sizes that I'm cold emailing now each of them is getting a relevant case study and relevancy is really the key to making that case study effective because if they see oh I recognize that company they're similar to me and they got that result now the prospect is going to think that they can do it too so the way that we've figured it out is segmenting based on industry so another way that you can segment those campaigns is with lookalikes so if you have a really good case study say for my company otter PR maybe you helped us scale to $600,000 a month maybe you were the sales guy to help us do it and you want to use us as a case study and Target company similar to us you can go to a platform like ocean. and create a lookalike audience for Otter PR now this a little expensive I use pandam match. for this where you can just plug in otter pr.com and it will go and it'll find similar companies to Otter PR and that way when I'm reaching out to those other companies and I'm using otter PR as a case study you can be damn sure that it is going to resonate with them because they're going to be very similar you can try a platform like ocean iio or Panda match to run these lookalike campaigns and use those case studies as your anchor case study for that campaign now for those of you wondering what that looks like this is pandam match. this is a search that I did on similar companies to Otter PR so how these websites work is they actually scrape every website on the internet and run them through AI so now they have descriptions keywords industry groups uh and they're able to match those keywords based on Source domains so I want to find domains similar to Otter PR and brand push uh this is going to give me a list of those domains with similarity scores and now I can export all of these to clay or to Apollo so I can download leads that match these these domains so this is what I do um I'll take this and I'll find leads in Apollo I'll find the decision makers at all of these websites push them into clay after that and then I'll put them into instantly in a campaign now this one I thought was really fun so a template they started seeing success with in 2024 it's called the case study overwhelm template they would use really Punchy messaging and below the signature just dump case studies now there's a couple things to learn from this that I I think is really impactful one is that they're dumping images so all of these case studies that they're using to in this case study overwhelm are screenshots uh and he addresses that down here if he thinks that an image is going to increase the response rate then you test it and send it he says I could just as easily send all these case studies as plain text but the screenshots make them sing and make sure to use real numbers if you help someone increase their row ass say 3.72 better than is better than 4% be very specific with the numbers but just going back to the image thing here guidelines that me and other experts give about cold email don't use links don't use videos don't use images are really just guidelines if you're sending a campaign that has images and that campaign's doing really well it's going to continue to do well if people aren't marking it as spam it's going to continue to deliver to the inbox just more traditionally it's harder to get through so think about all of the rules like don't send links don't send videos don't send images just as rough guidelines but feel free to break them and to test them and this is a really good example of that now Eric breaks down some copywriting tricks he calls it poke the bear honestly this is just creative copywriting to me so instead of asking how's the training going for your Iron Man ask how are you thinking about training for your Iron Man so you don't get shin splints in the next 8 weeks so really this is just being a lot more specific about that pain point now if you wanted to you could probably just take this section copy and paste it put it into chat GPT and say to transform your copy to be more like this and the punchier copy typically Works a little bit better so this I could not agree with you more Eric anyone who offers really ridiculous guarantees in a cold email goes immediately into my counter pitch folder where I'm not reading it it's just going to send you a cold email back so just like me Eric is also super skeptical about guarantees in fact I love what they did here he is an anti-g guarantee at growth engine X if you're the kind of person that needs a guarantee we suggest you work with someone else so many people come to me after reading Alex foros stupid book not stupid it was a great book but they have these crazy offers and guarantees that are too good to say no where they're going to guarantee 100,000 in revenue or they're going to give them a a free Corvette or something stupid any email like that goes straight into the bucket it's just a really fast way to blow your credibility and I do not recommend doing it if you want to make your offer too good to be true don't do it with guarantees do it with social proof and credibility it's going to work much better this is another really important point that I want to highlight what can you say in an email that no one else can say so there's a thousand SEO agencies video editors all emailing the same thing to the same people if you can say something that cuts through the noise that nobody else can really say then it's it's going to get my attention for example I got a cold email yesterday from somebody who does the video editing for instantly AI no one else can say that they do the video editing for AI so I immediately trusted him and I responded to that email so think about what can you say that no one else can say doesn't have to be social proof or credibility a lot of times it could be an offer that you can execute that nobody else can uh so figure out what that is and it will totally unlock your results all right we're getting close to the end my friends now we're going to get into some of the more modern stuff some of the more fun stuff that's a little bit more advanced that we're doing in 2025 so trigger messaging what is trigger messaging when something happens that's a Trigger action now you send them an email or contact them about that thing so here's some examples of different triggers a lot of these are available to you right there in Apollo new enroll hiring Tech installed past company experience all of these are different triggers that you can utilize in your campaigns now this is an important point a lot of these triggers are overused they're not super modern they're not super creative everybody knows that they exist so instead of just saying hey I saw you're hiring an SDR bu my cold email service you should actually go a step deeper and this is what he says here take a step further and say something insightful about the job description and connect it to your offer so if someone is hiring an SDR instead of just saying s you're hiring an SDR um you're going to be doing this manually why not use me actually use AI to analyze the job description and write an AI personalization related to it this tactic here is called so what messaging so here's an example of what that is so so what messaging is something that you can test it's probably not going to be night and day instead of saying hey we do be bookkeeping you'll say something like we do bookkeeping so what and then you'll say we do bookkeeping so what we do bookkeeping so you can make accurate decisions about what you can pay yourself this is something probably worth running a split test on this is what I said in the comments but it's probably not going to make or break your campaign but definitely something to try and I thought it was worth mentioning in this video next is problem sniffing this one was pretty interesting we actually use problem sniffing in different ways any way that I can creatively figure out how to do it this is especially relevant if you have an offer that you can use AI to identify a problem with for example an SEO offer I can go through your website and tell you how many website errors you have with a simple automation if you're a reputation management company I can go through reviews and call out specific negative reviews this is problem sniffing I'm using AI to expose problems in your business and then I'm addressing those problems in the cold Outreach and this is essentially what he's saying here you're looking for problems that you're going to solve and you're ideally looking with AI and now with clay.com you can do that all Under One Roof with one platform it makes it unbelievably easy so here Eric talks about information Arbitrage the thing that I think is worth mentioning in this section is that you're typically an expert in whatever it is that you're selling you have some kind of knowledge that's going to entice your prospect to take a call think about how you're going to leverage that to get them on the phone for example I know how to aut make your LinkedIn account to message 100 people per day not connection requests direct messages into their inbox I'd love to show you how to do it over a quick call now you're not just getting on a call with me for you to sell you something I'm actually going to be giving you value on that call so think about what piece of information you have in your industry that you can offer to them as Reciprocity for spending the time on a call with you and use it in this information Arbitrage way if you take a second and write down some industry secrets that you think are hyper valuable I bet you're going to be able to come up with some really creative stuff so now touching back on implicit objections if you have an offer and you can detect that there's all of these objections that are going to come up I don't trust him that's going to take way too much time this is not going to technically work if you want any chance of the campaign succeeding when they have those implicit objections you need to address them right away all right some other tactics worth checking out on your own relevantly funny Tastefully provocative founder story so I thought this one was worth highlighting if you can establish common ground with the person that you're emailing then you're more likely to get a response from them so the founder story actually works quite well especially if you're emailing somebody who's from your industry who likely had a similar Journey that you had if you're a tech developer and you have a tech product and you're emailing Tech Founders you should use this you should use the founder story chances are you have more Rapport more commonality with them than you think so my comment here was if you can establish common ground and they can relate to you they'll respond so any commonality you can find is good dogs colleges cities they all work put it all into that founder story anywhere that you think you can build commonality and it's going to help improve your campaign I thought this was worth highlighting as well lean into your mechanism or leave it out chances are if you're an agency or you're a consultant you might think that what you're doing is unique but unless it's actually unique the mechanism is actually unique then you should probably just not talk about it at all for example if you help me get on page Buton Google by posting blogs and getting back links I don't need to know about it it's much more important for you to focus on the results than focusing on the mechanism however if you generate leads for me by WhatsApp Automation in clay.com using a a secret workflow that no one's used before yeah lean into that I want to know about it put it in there I'm curious now I'm in so this is just going to require you to really know yourself and your offer very well and decide whether or not to lean into the mechanism or lean away and focus on results and case studies all right I highlighted this whole section attention hacking because it's just a list of tactics that you can use to bait somebody into opening and responding but he says something really good here I'm going to read it word for word attention hacking most often works when you're targeting industries that don't receive sophisticated emails so if you're emailing SAS CEOs or Ecom Founders they're going to see right through these things due to the amount of emails they get in my comment cheap tricks to marketing agency owners or SAS owners can actually hurt your campaigns so this attention hacking section these are the cheap tricks do they work maybe should you test them probably but if you're emailing people like me who are used to getting cold emailed they're actually going to hurt the results of your campaign so here's a couple examples of attention hacking the fake email forward so pretending that someone in your company forwarded you the email and says that they should reach out to them uh this I'm sure you've seen this one before if you've studied cold email so super short emails one to two sentences they actually quite often work especially if you're really Punchy into the point sending the whole email in the subject line really unique have I seen it work yes do we do it absolutely not some other examples Whimsical culture debate you can read that one on your own and then AI attention hacking so now you can call out their most recent LinkedIn Post Restaurant PS line College tradition subject line what's more important is the thing things that we now avoid in our copywriting so things to avoid in your copywriting I hope this email finds you well Eric agrees they don't use it we don't use that anymore we try and avoid any corporate jargon like incentivize comprehensive streamline AI likes to pull these words so anytime we're prompting AI we tell it specifically to avoid it and keep it at a sixth grade reading level this is kind of reiterating what we've already talked about essentially keeping the email short and the sequences short short emails actually work and short SE quences actually work you just need to be concise with the messaging and say the right thing so he says that they avoid I made a super custom video going over your website and how it can be approved can I send it to you yeah if this is fake and you're going to send them some BS video when you're done that's AI generated this can actually hurt however with that being said there's a lot of great tools now to make it a lot more accessible and easy to do a decent enough job to get them onto a call one tool that you can use for this is sendler doai and I've tried to campaign with it worked quite well we tell somebody that we made a video for them I just respond yes and we'll send the video over once they respond yes it triggers that web hook creates the video sends it over to them it's got their name in AI it's got their website and then goes into a slideshow with that being said don't tell them that it's super custom don't tell them that they're going to learn a specific thing if they're not actually going to learn that thing and this is where you have to get really creative and like dance with the words that you use but people do like to receive videos so that tactic still does work I wouldn't not write it off completely now this section here Eric talks about how he finds a working campaign for a new client so if you're running a lead genen agency I would definitely read this entire section if you're not and you're just doing this for yourself uh I'm going to give you the important takeaways and highlights that I got from this so he'll typically do this in four batches so if batch one works I think he stops if this does not work he goes to two and then three and then four each one of these batches is slightly more complicated to execute so hopefully one works so batch one he'll do a lookalike targeting with AI generated copy so I actually like writing the copy myself for these campaigns I've noticed the AI just doesn't quite do it the way that I want to do it especially with like the creative baiting that I like to do but I guess he's found a way to make it work quite well and systematize it batch two they test triggers and changing the list a lot batch three they stop using the AI copy and they write manual copy and then batch four they do things that aren't quite scalable but they create hypers specific lists that guide the copyrighting so I can get into some examples of what this might look like later so batch one we kind of talked about this lookalike campaign here's how it's structured if you're following along uh go ahead and look at this template again I don't agree with it word for word because as soon as I got this email I would know I'm about to be pitched and would go into the folder but other than that it all looks good and I actually use a very similar template other than the first sentence his standard email sequence template is very similar this is a really helpful section for everybody who's putting together campaigns for their first time because if you do this and granted there's Nuance with what you say in the first line how you prompt the AI but if you roughly follow this this template and you say the right thing and you have a decent offer you're probably going to be successful so what you should notice about Eric's copy and we're doing this more and more too is that there's a lot of AI personalization thrown in here so you need to have good AI prompts and good data to be able to do this sucess successfully so this first line AI generated and then this second line also AI generated and he says what works so well about this is they can use the AI to help the prospect imagine how they can help them so the AI is trained on what the prospect company does and what they do to add value so if you're going to follow these templates just keep in mind that they might only work for Eric because of this AI so you need to be using something like clay to be able to Output an em like this so creative ideas campaign so this one is also one of his favorite and he says most successful so important thing to keep a note here that this works really really well you'll also notice we've got an AI generated Miss Mission and ideas 1 through three also AI generated so he's using clay and these clay jents to generate these these emails these personalizations that makes these campaigns so successful all right feel free to take a look at these templates and give them a try he made this available for everybody so I don't think he will mind so batch two we already t talked about triggers I'm not going to go too detailed in here uh the one thing I do want to highlight is the golden ICP I'm just going to read the golden ICP word for word so golden ICP is a test where we really leverage data to find the perfect person not just a tech founder a tech founder that recently raised money who's never been a Founder before the company was founded two years ago and the company has no bookkeeper or accountant on their team so stacking really specific variables to find the perfect person and he acknowledges this is really difficult to do at scale but if you use tools like clay.com you can really hyper qualify those leads campaign three this is batch three poking the bear this is where you're really changing a lot of the copy around to try and find something that works so I would also advise that if you really can't find something that works to try some of these tactics and tricks the attention hacking a lot of it does actually end up working there's always a way to make every offer work for cold email you just need to figure out what that way is so throw the attention hacking throw in the lead magnets throw in the tactics run through this document and just test things until something finally works and batch four this is the really hyp specific lists so he mentions a couple of things here and we're going to go more into detail on this in just a second but this is I think the future 2025 this is what we're doing this is really cool stuff scraping LinkedIn groups and engagement works really well so people who are in LinkedIn groups engaging commenting liking they've pretty much already select themselves as interested in that thing so you can scrape these people and then once you have their LinkedIn profiles getting their emails just one step away now I'm actually using a tool called trigery to do pretty much exactly this um you can find people who are engaging with certain topics on LinkedIn so maybe not groups but I can come in here and search topics and then export their LinkedIn accounts really easily these are really great signals that somebody's interested in a specific thing all right we're nearing the Finish Line hang tight how do use AI in your outbound campaigns Eric's one of the Masters of this so I thought it was worth spending some time actually valuating some of his notes and this is a great way to think about it I love how he phrased this I'm going to read it word for word you should research a prospect in a company for 10 minutes and write them a manual email take note of what you check their website their LinkedIn industry blogs their pricing page how did the research that you did change the message that when you wrote it this is fundamentally how you should be using your AI in your campaigns start with what you would manually do and work backwards from there so below here he gives an example of all of these AI personalizations that are traditionally used you can run through these on your own time some of them are like company Mission summary title and time and roll recommendation call out LinkedIn post call out now there is a big list here these are ways that you can use AI prompts to enhance your campaign you'll need to be the creative one to choose which one to use and when to use it depending on who your ICP is what your offer and how it's going to enhance your campaign now I also want to say that using these ineffectively using them wrong or choosing something that's going to fail a lot is just going to complicate your campaign for example if you want to reach out to a company and mention somebody else at that company by name you better be damn sure that your AI or your Cent is going to be able to find someone else at that company by that name if not and it's failing half of the time it's going to make your campaign and your architecture of that campaign a lot harder to maintain so find personalizations that are successful at least 90% of the time and you can run through these on your own time all right gang that wraps up this video I want to thank Eric for
